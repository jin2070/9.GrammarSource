<p>The World English Bible is  in the Public Domain. That means that it is not copyrighted. However, "World English Bible" is a Trademark.</p>
<p>You may copy, publish, proclaim, distribute, redistribute, sell, give away, quote, memorize, read publicly, broadcast, transmit, share, back up, post on the Internet, print, reproduce, preach, teach from, and use the World English Bible as much as you want, and others may also do so. All we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the World English Bible in any way, you not call the result the World English Bible any more. This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who have worked on this translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the Public Domain.</p>
<p>Donations to help with the expenses of this project and thus help others have free access to the Word of God may be made to us, but are not required. Please see <a href="http://MLJohnson.org/partner/">http://MLJohnson.org/partner/</a> for more about that.</p>
<p>The World English Bible is a work in progress. All Old Testament and New Testament books are essentially done, but well-justified typo reports and translation suggestions will still be considered. Editing work continues on the companion Apocrypha/Deuterocanon/Psuedepigrapha books, mostly in the form of slight updates to language and punctuation, but the meaning should be correct as those books read now.
The companion Apocrypha/Deuterocanon of the World English Bible is mostly in a rough draft form, as an automated language update of portions of the Apocrypha from the <a href="http://eBible.org/eng-rv/">Revised Version</a> and portions from the <a href="http://eBible.org/eng-lxx2012/">LXX2012: Septuagint in English 2012</a>. Of those books, Tobit, Judith, Esther (Greek), and Psalm 151 are essentially done.
New updates will be posted on <a href="http://eBible.org/web/">http://eBible.org/web/</a> and at <a href="http://WorldEnglishBible.org">http://WorldEnglishBible.org</a>.</p>
